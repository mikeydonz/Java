# Continents

This program will ask the user to enter a continent and will then return the most populated city within the entered continent and it's location. If the user eneters an invalid continent then it will ask the user to try again. There are 2 imported libraries: one to read the user's input and assign it to a variable and the other to implement a delay in the program execution so the program will be more user-friendly. The program also implements loops and switch cases.

To use the program:

1. Download/clone it from the repo.

2. Compile the java file using this command: javac Continents.java

3. Execute the compiled program using this command: java Continents
